> “You're new to these parts, traveler. Want to join a new infosec campaign party I’m forming? We’re defending the castle, and don’t have enough heroes to – wait. Where’s your sword?! You can’t defend with a *lute*!” 

Actually, you *can.* 

See, last year, I faced that same skepticism from infosec hiring managers: no IT background. After a slew of rejections, I found some old 20-sided-dice… and I realized I needed to completely reframe my previous career. 

Now? I’m a threat analyst for a cyber research group. 

So, let me show you how you, too, can pivot into information security during this 4-hour RPG tabletop campaign-workshop! 

I’ll guide participant-players through a modern infosec hiring process RPG tabletop “campaign” workshop, acting as the game master as participant-players reskill their classes and adjust their application strategies to win a coveted role for their infosec party. 

In the end, you’ll walk away with concrete research, tools, and techniques to help your next employer properly value and respect your current non-infosec skills and experience in your first infosec role.

## Flipping Bits: Your Credentials Are Certainly Mine
### [Black Hat General Session] Thurs. Aug. 8 from 11:20am-12:00pm PDT at OceansideA, Level 2

https://www.blackhat.com/us-24/briefings/schedule/index.html#flipping-bits-your-credentials-are-certainly-mine-40040

> Did you know that if you change a single bit from 1 to 0 (or vice versa) in the first 'g' of the domain name google.com (which is 01100111 in binary) you will end up with a variety of valid "bitflip" domains like coogle.com, oogle.com, and woogle.com

So what happens if you generate and register a bunch of cheap bitfliped versions of popular cloud / Saas provider domains, point them to your VPS, log all incoming requests and then forget about the whole thing for two years?

Well, you will in fact receive a stiff bill, generate huge log files and eventually run out of disk space. But on the upside, you will also have collected a treasure trove of legit credentials and interesting stuff like valid OAuth refresh tokens, JWT tokens, bearers, cookies, emails, meeting invites with passwords and truckloads of internet scanner noise.

This accidental finding paved the path for the tool 'Certainly' a pioneering offensive / defensive tool. Designed to simplify long term passive credential harvesting and payload deployment of bitflip-typosquatting domains. 'Certainly' will intercept and analyze any incoming requests, employ Wildcard DNS matching and on-the-fly generated SSL certificates for any incoming requests, across various protocols. All with the intention of downgrading security, poisoning dns caches, harvesting credentials, capturing emails, replacing dependencies with custom payloads and bypassing current security protections.

In this session, we will not only revisit and expand on previously published bitflip research from the last decade and reveal its surprising frequency and impact on modern web technology and cloud infrastructure, but also showcase how you too can use 'certainly' in your next red-team engagement and explain the mitigations needed to defend against this kind of non-human generated attacks.

## Rubik's Cube Tactics: How Rotating Resource Strategies Solved Real-World Cyberattacks
### [Black Hat Sponsored Lunch & Learn] Thurs. Aug. 8 from 1pm - 2pm PDT at Lagoon KL, Level 2

https://www.blackhat.com/us-24/sponsored-sessions/schedule/index.html#rubiks-cube-tactics-how-rotating-resource-strategies-solved-real-world-cyberattacks-41722

> Like solving a Rubik's cube, effective infosec strategies require proactive consideration of – and solving for – both technology and team together. From active response capabilities to intelligence-driven risk mitigation, each facet of your organization's security "puzzle" twists into the next.

Solving your security puzzle through better team and technology alignment creates a complete infosec program that's greater than the sum of its parts.

When your security puzzle is left half-solved, threats can – and will – slip between the cracks in your defenses.

Join the Adversary Pursuit Group (APG), as we present original research and analysis of three recent cyberattacks within Blackpoint Active SOC-protected environments to prove how technology and people must work together to solve complex real-world infosec problems, including:

- Novel cloud-based attacks against a Critical Infrastructure partner featuring possible insider threats and business email compromise (BEC);
- Supply-chain and third-party-based attacks against multiple MSPs, occurring after a "theoretical" proof of concept publication; and
- A ransomware attack deployed under four minutes against a Healthcare partner.
